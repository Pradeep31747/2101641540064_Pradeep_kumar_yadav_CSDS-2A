## Introduction
Linked lists are fundamental data structures that consist of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next one. This repository includes implementations of singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.

## Implementations
The following implementations are available:
- **Singly Linked List**: Basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Operations that support traversal in both directions.
- **Circular Linked List**: A variant where the last node points back to the first node.

### Example Files
- `singly_linked_list.py`: Implementation of a singly linked list.
- `doubly_linked_list.py`: Implementation of a doubly linked list.
- `circular_linked_list.py`: Implementation of a circular linked list.

## Usage
To use these implementations, clone the repository and run the respective Python files. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linked-list-programs.git
cd linked-list-programs
python singly_linked_list.py
python doubly_linked_list.py
python circular_linked_list.py
